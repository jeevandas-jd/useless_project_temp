## 🌟 Project Description
*Pheromone Frenzy* puts you in control of a thriving ant colony, guiding them to collect food through an intricate grid filled with obstacles and hazards. Through strategic pheromone placement, players influence the ants' path to maximize food collection within a limited time.

### 💡 The Problem (that doesn’t exist)
Ever thought ants needed a bit of human intervention to optimize their trails? Or maybe the world’s ready for ant-powered resource management? We’re solving a problem only a very niche crowd is passionate about!

### 🛠️ The Solution (that nobody asked for)
You’re the ultimate colony manager! Drop pheromones to direct ants, avoid hazards, and gather food, making your ants the most efficient foragers in the insect kingdom!
